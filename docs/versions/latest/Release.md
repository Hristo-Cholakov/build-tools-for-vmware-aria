### Remove prompt and property for vro_delete_include_dependencies
The `installer` script shows a prompt "Clean up vRO dependent packages as well?" about deleting "dependent packages" and stores the answer in the `vro_delete_include_depenedencies` property but does nothing regardless of the answer.

#### Previous Behavior
There was prompt in interactive mode for vRO regarding the deletion of dependent packages.

#### New Behavior
The unnecessary question regarding dependent packages in vRO projects is removed.

#### Relevant Documentation
**NONE**
