## Improvements



### **.helper.ts files will now be excluded from type definitions* 
Currently the *.helper.ts files are being transpiled, and definitions are being generated. This shouldn't be happening, 
as there is no reason to have helper files as part of the definitions, since they are test related only.

#### Previous Behavior
The helper.ts files had type definitions generated for them since vrotsc did not detect them correctly.

#### New Behavior
The helper.ts are now being correctly filtered out by vrtosc, by excluding files that end with: `.helper.ts`.

#### Relevant Documentation:
* None
